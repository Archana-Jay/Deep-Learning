# Deep-Learning

Object-centric image classification is a task that involves training a model to classify images based on the objects present within them. The goal is to teach the model to recognize different objects within an image and accurately classify the image based on those objects. This task has numerous real-world applications, such as identifying objects within a security camera feed, recognizing products in an online shopping catalog, or detecting potential hazards within a medical image. The key challenge in this task is to train the model to recognize objects in different orientations, sizes, and lighting conditions, as well as to handle the presence of multiple objects within the same image.
In this final Project, we implemented an Object Centric Image Recognition task using the mentioned dataset with Deep CNN classification using Autoencoder.
About the Dataset- we used three different datasets CIFAR10, CalTech101, CalTech256.
